Use a VRM file and make them move around a bit for streaming etc. Listens to key inputs globally.

WASD is move, shift is run, space is jump

run `yarn setup` then `yarn start [--width nnn] [--height nnn] [--greenscreen[=#aarrggbb]] [--always-on-top]`

or just download the release and click "RUNME.vbs" lol

it is transparent and there's no title bar so if you wanna move it you will have to hit alt+space then hit M, then use arrow keys to move it around. Or use greenscreen mode and have OBS chroma-key it
